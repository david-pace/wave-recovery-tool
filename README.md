# Wave Recovery Tool

Tool to display WAVE/AIFF file header information and to restore corrupted WAVE/AIFF file headers.

This program was originally developed to recover damaged audio files which were destroyed due to a bug in the audio application *Logic*. See [this blog post](https://www.davidpace.de/when-logic-destroys-your-audio-files/) for more details.

## Authors

* The Wave Recovery Tool core is developed by David Pace &lt;dev@davidpace.de&gt;
* The Graphical User Interface is a highly appreciated contribution by DRCRecoveryData &lt;hanaloginstruments@gmail.com&gt;

## Prerequisites

To use the wave recovery tool, a [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installation is required.

This tool is capable of reconstructing damaged WAVE and AIFF headers. This will only work if the raw audio data is still in the file, i.e. the file has a reasonable file size in respect to the duration of the recorded audio material (usually several megabytes). In a typical scenario where recovery is possible, one of the following happens when you try to play the audio file:

* Logic displays the error `One or more audio files changed in length.`
* Audio players (like VLC, Audacity, Windows Media Player, QuickTime, iTunes) display errors
* You hear noise
* You simply hear nothing

## Step by Step Instructions with Graphical User Interface

**Note:** Alternative instructions for Mac users are provided below.

1. Download [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install Python 3
3. Open a Terminal / Command Line
4. Install PyQt6 with the following command: `pip install pyqt6` (on some systems, the command might be `pip3 install pyqt6`)
5. On the [Github page of Wave Recovery Tool](https://github.com/david-pace/wave-recovery-tool), click the green **Code** button at the top right corner of the page, then click **Download ZIP** and save the ZIP file to your Desktop.
6. Extract the downloaded ZIP file. This should result in a folder named `wave-recovery-tool-master` containing the program on your Desktop.
7. Locate the damaged audio files. If you used Logic, these will be located near your project file in a folder named `Media/Audio Files`. If you saved your project to a `.logicx` container, the contents can be shown in Finder by right-clicking the `.logicx` file and choosing *Show Package Contents*.
8. Create a folder named `audio` on your desktop and copy the damaged audio files into that folder.
9. Create an empty folder called `restored` on your desktop.
10. Open the folder `wave-recovery-tool-master` on your desktop and double-click the file `waverecoverygui.py`. The graphical user interface should appear. If this should not happen, the GUI has to be started from the command line. Open a terminal, navigate into the `wave-recovery-tool-master` directory on your `Desktop` using the commands `cd Desktop` and `cd wave-recovery-tool-master`, then finally run `python waverecoverygui.py` (on some systems, the command might be `python3 waverecoverygui.py`).
11. Use the folder `audio` on your desktop as source folder.
12. Use the folder `restored` on your desktop as destination folder.
13. Provide the sample rate, bit depth and number of channels that were used while recording the damaged audio files.
14. Click *Restore*.
15. Try playing back the files in the `restored` folder **with a low loudness/volume level**, as they might be distorted.
16. If the sound is distorted or you hear nothing, you have to repeat from step 13, but this time try other parameters.

### Alternative instructions for Mac users

1. Install Homebrew as described on [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/).
2. Run `brew install python3` in a terminal to install Python 3.
3. Run `brew install pyqt6` to install PyQt6.
4. Proceed with step 5 above.

## Step by Step Instructions for Command Line Usage

1. Download [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install Python 3. If the installation provides an option to add Python 3 to your environment variables (especially the `PATH` variable), then enable it. You might have to look for "customized" or "advanced" options for that. Remember the location where Python 3 was installed.
3. On the [Github page of Wave Recovery Tool](https://github.com/david-pace/wave-recovery-tool), click the green **Code** button at the top right corner of the page, then click **Download ZIP** and save the ZIP file to your Desktop.
4. Extract the downloaded ZIP file. This should result in a folder named `wave-recovery-tool-master` containing the program on your Desktop.
5. Locate the damaged audio files. If you used Logic, these will be located near your project file in a folder named `Media/Audio Files`. If you saved your project to a `.logicx` container, the contents can be shown in Finder by right-clicking the `.logicx` file and choosing *Show Package Contents*.
6. Create a folder named `audio` on your desktop and copy the damaged audio files into that folder. 
7. Open a terminal application. Depending on your operating system, it is called **Command Line**, **Terminal** or similar.
8. Each terminal has a so called **working directory**, which is the file system context for executed programs. Typically, the terminal starts in your user directory. On Windows, this might be something like `C:\Users\homersimpson`, on Unix-based/Mac systems it is something like `/Users/homersimpson`. This directory is sometimes abbreviated as `~`. When a terminal is started, the current working directory is usually your user directory. Enter the command `cd Desktop` and hit enter to make `Desktop` your working directory. Hint: you can usually use the TAB key to auto-complete the folder names.
9. Analyze the audio files in your `audio` folder by entering one of the following commands:
    * On Windows, enter: `python wave-recovery-tool-master\waverecovery.py audio`
    * On Unix-based/Mac systems, enter: `python3 wave-recovery-tool-master/waverecovery.py audio`
10. If it works, you see header information for the files in your audio folder. If you get an error like `command not found` or similar, try replacing `python` with `python3` and vice versa. If you still get the same error, refer to section *Locating Python 3* below.
11. In case you see any header errors (prefixed with [ERROR]) in the output of step 9, you can try to fix the files. For that, you simply have to add `-r` before `audio` and add a destination folder (we will call it `restored`) after audio. The resulting command lines look like this:
    * Windows: `python wave-recovery-tool-master\waverecovery.py -r audio restored`
    * Unix/Mac: `python3 wave-recovery-tool-master/waverecovery.py -r audio restored`
12. The command from step 11 will create a folder named `restored` on your Desktop and try to restore the audio files from the folder `audio` into the `restored` folder. Check if the folder was created and whether it contains files. Try playing back the files **with a low loudness/volume level**, as they might be distorted.
13. If the sound is distorted or you hear nothing, you have to repeat from step 11, but this time add other parameters (namely the sample rate, number of channels and/or bit rate you used during recording). Examples:
    * If the files were recorded with a bit depth of 24 bits then you have to add `-b 24` before `audio`.
    * If you used a sample rate of 48 kHz, you have to add `-s 48000` before `audio`.
    * If the files have two channels (i.e. stereo instead of mono), then you have to add `-c 2` before `audio`.
    * See section *Restoring Damaged WAVE/AIFF File Headers* for more details.
    
### Locating Python 3
 
In case you get an error message like `command not found` in step 9, you have to replace `python` or `python3` with the absolute path to your python executable. On Windows, the command line looks like this:

```
"C:\Program Files\Python\Python37-32\python" wave-recovery-tool-master\waverecovery.py audio
```

Note that you have to add quotes around the python path if it contains spaces (like in `Program Files`). On Unix systems, the command like looks like:

```
/usr/local/bin/python3 wave-recovery-tool-master/waverecovery.py audio
```

Of course, you have to replace the python executable paths with the actual paths on your system where Python3 was installed (the path you remembered in step 1 of the step-by-step instructions).

## Command Line Usage

The tool provides two functionalities:

1. Displaying WAVE/AIFF file header information
2. Restoring corrupted WAVE/AIFF file headers

For all commands below, `python3` is assumed to be in the system's executable `PATH`. If your system reports that `python3` can not be found, its containing directory must either be added to the `PATH` variable or `python3` must be replaced with the absolute path to the Python 3 interpreter. The command `python3` must be replaced with `python` on some Windows systems. Also refer to the previous section *Locating Python 3* if you encounter problems.

Note that on all Windows systems, file system paths are separated with backslashes (`\`) instead of slashes (`/`).


### Displaying Header File Information

To display header information for a specific audio file, invoke the tool as follows:

```
python3 wave-recovery-tool-master/waverecovery.py /path/to/file.wav
```

The tool can also display audio header information for all files contained in a directory:

```
python3 wave-recovery-tool-master/waverecovery.py /path/to/directory
```

All available header fields will be shown. In case a wave file header is damaged, error messages prefixed with `[ERROR]` will be displayed. In case size headers (particularly `chunk size` and `data subchunk size`) are not consistent with the overall wave file size, warnings prefixed with `[WARNING]` will be displayed. An example output for a working file looks like this:

```
Displaying WAVE File Header Data for File MyWaveFile.wav
Number of Bytes: 1371644
Reading WAVE Header...
Chunk Size: 1371636
Skipping JUNK chunk (size: 28).
Reading fmt chunk (size: 16)
Audio Format: 1
Number of Channels: 1
Sample Rate: 48000
Byte Rate (number of bytes per second): 144000
Bytes per Sample in all Channels (Block Align): 3
Bits per Sample: 24
Reading data chunk (size: 1367984).
[WARNING] Data subchunk size does not match file size. Should be 1371572, but is: 1367984 (difference: 3588)
```

The example output for a damaged file looks like this:

```
Displaying WAVE File Header Data for File MyDamagedWaveFile.wav
Number of Bytes: 59100494
Reading WAVE Header...
[ERROR] File does not start with 'RIFF' and therefore does not contain a correct wave file header.
```

### Restoring Damaged WAVE/AIFF File Headers

This tool is capable of restoring damaged WAVE/AIFF files under the following conditions:

- The audio file header is damaged or contains errors
- The raw audio data is still stored in the file after the damaged header 

The tool will write a valid WAVE/AIFF file header and append the available raw audio data.
To restore damaged wave files, supply the `--restore` (short: `-r`) option along with a source and destination path. Source and destination path can either be:

- A source file and a destination file or
- A source directory and a destination directory

In the second case, the source directory will be scanned for audio files and the restored versions of the files will be saved in the destination folder.

If no further parameters are supplied, the following defaults are assumed:

- Sample Rate: 44,100 Hz
- Bits per Sample: 16
- Number of channels: 1 (Mono)

These values can be changed with the following parameters:

- Sample Rate: `-s` or `--sample_rate` 
- Bits per Sample: `-b` or `--bits_per_sample`
- Number of Channels: `-c` or `--channels`

Examples are provided below.

#### Examples

Note that on all Windows systems, file system paths are separated with backslashes (`\`) instead of slashes (`/`).

Restore audio files with

- 44 kHz sample rate
- 16 bits per sample
- 1 channel (Mono)

```
python3 wave-recovery-tool-master/waverecovery.py -r audio restored
```

Restore audio files with

- 44 kHz sample rate
- 24 bits per sample
- 1 channel (Mono)

```
python3 wave-recovery-tool-master/waverecovery.py -r -b 24 audio restored
```

Restore audio files with

- 96 kHz sample rate
- 24 bits per sample
- 1 channel (Mono)


```
python3 wave-recovery-tool-master/waverecovery.py -r -s 96000 -b 24 audio restored
```

Restore audio files with

- 96 kHz sample rate
- 24 bits per sample
- 2 channels (Stereo)


```
python3 wave-recovery-tool-master/waverecovery.py -r -s 96000 -b 24 -c 2 audio restored
```

### Enforcing Recovery Attempts

By default, the tool will only recover files in which errors were detected explicitly. If only warnings were found (indicating only minor inconsistencies) no attempt to recover the files will be made. This might also be the case if the tool failed to detect errors correctly. If the recovery should be attempted nonetheless, the parameter `--force` (short: `-f`) can be provided as shown in the next example:

```
python3 wave-recovery-tool-master/waverecovery.py -r -f -s 96000 -b 24 -c 2 audio restored
```

### Specifying Applications

In some cases the tool requires additional information about the application that originally created/damaged the input file(s). By default, the tool assumes that the files were destroyed by Apple Logic. The tool also supports restoring files destroyed by Ableton Live and a ransomware called Stop/Djvu. To provide information about the application, use the `-a` or `--application` parameter. The following application names are supported:

```
-a logic (Apple Logic, default)
-a live (Ableton Live)
-a djvu (Stop/Djvu Ransomware)
```

Example for Ableton Live:

```
python3 wave-recovery-tool-master/waverecovery.py -r -s 96000 -b 24 -c 2 -a live audio restored
```

Example for Stop/Djvu:

```
python3 wave-recovery-tool-master/waverecovery.py -r -s 96000 -b 16 -a djvu audio restored
```

Providing the application parameter will aid the tool in computing the correct start and end offsets for the audio data.

### Specifying Custom Audio Data Offsets

If nothing else is specified, the tool will assume that the audio data starts at offset 44 in WAVE files, and at offset 512 in AIFF files. If the audio data starts at a different offset, it can be specified using the `-o` or `--offset` parameter.

Similarly, a custom end offset can be specified. If no end offset is given, the data will be copied until the very end of the input file. Use the parameter `-e` or  `--end_offset` to specify a custom end offset.

Offsets must be specified as integer value. It is also supported to supply negative integer values. In this case the offset will be interpreted as a position relative to the end of the file.

For example, the following command line will copy audio data starting at offset `153608` until `334` bytes before the end of the file:

```
python3 wave-recovery-tool-master/waverecovery.py -r -s 96000 -b 24 -o 153608 -e -334
```
